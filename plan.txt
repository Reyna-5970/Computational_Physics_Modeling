***PLANNING DOCUMENT***

represent airplane using airfoil for wing

2 parts: 
	a) launch
		i. obtain target height with PID
		ii. simulate sensor feedback
		iii. produce x(t), v(t), L(t) graphs from flight path
		iv. use bernoulli's for lift (temporarily...) --> sad reyna because incorrectly applying to two different streamlines :(
	b) lander sim
		i. report success (crash? Y/n)
		ii. in the case of a crash, which parts failed?
		iii. account for atmos. conditions for specified planet
