represent airplane using airfoil for wing

2 parts: 
	a) launch
		i. obtain target height with PID
		ii. simulate sensor feedback
		iii. produce x(t), v(t), L(t) graphs from flight path
		iv. use bernoulli's for lift (temporarily...)
	b) lander sim
		i. report success (crash? Y/n)
		ii. in the case of a crash, which parts failed?
		iii. account for atmos. conditions for specified planet
